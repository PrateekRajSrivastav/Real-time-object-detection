# Real-time-object-detection
Developed a real-time object detection pipeline leveraging YOLO and Python for efficient and accurate identification of objects in visual data. Utilized the Ultralytics library to implement and train the YOLO model. Employed Roboflow for comprehensive data annotation, preprocessing.
